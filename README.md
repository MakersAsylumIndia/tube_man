# tube_man
mini inflatable tube man, desktop sized

- there are two 3D printed parts and two laser cut 3mm acrylic parts
- for the inflatable tube man, you need nylon or similar material that does not leak air and will fall/crumple under its own weight (should not bend over/fold like paper)
- the fan is rated for 12V, but runs well using a 9V/1A wall wart adaptor.
- for assembly guide, check the sequence of images in the /renders folder
